## Our Assignment
We wanted to create a Napoleon cipher encoder/decoder using the key "joseferreiraportugal".
We want to be able to test this by sending in ascii-values for characters ending with the Enter-value. The output should be a decoded message, and again we should be able to test vice versa. Sending in ascii-values that the output shows to be able to provide the original sentence.

## Our Solution
We created two diagrams: FSM Diagram and ASM Diagram. We structured the task among us:
- Finite State Machine (Control Path) and FSM/ASM Diagrams - Christopher
- UART Receive and UART Tranmit  - Ole
- ROM and ROM-counter - Aditi
- RAM and counter - Hannes
- Cipher Function - Shahin
- Top Module - Oscar

## Our Result
